        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <pre>
          Phishing is a form of online identity theft targeting to steal sensitive information from an end user <cite>phishing_attacks_and_solutions_2007, why_phishing_works_06, suspectibility_to_phishing_2006</cite>. Victims are tricked into providing such information by a combination of spoofing techniques and social engineering <cite>visual_similarity_phishing_2008</cite>. The process usually involves a fraudulent web site imitating a specific authentic site. 

          The goal is to trick the user submitting his secret information to the fraudulent imitation site that could be later used by somebody else to access the original service. The user can be lured to a fraudulent phishing site in many ways. A common way is to send the victim an email or instant message that asks him to visit a malicious site. Additionally, if that message appears to come from a friend or a trusted social network, the more effectively it will work. The goal is to acquire sensitive information, such as a username and password, by masquerading the malicious site as a particular trustworthy entity.

          Phishing is a widespread problem on the internet [CITE, CITE, CITE]. It poses a risk that affects especially a single sign-on system. Studies of Dhamija et al. <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite> show that in order for a phishing attempt to be convincing, it must be targeted to a specific system. Since a single sign-on system provides access to multiple services, a successful phishing attempt targeted against the identity provider affects all its identity consumers. Therefore identity providers are a viable target for phishing by their very nature [CITE, CITE].

          Being an attractive target for phishing might give an impression that single sign-on systems should be avoided for business critical services [CITE]. Nevertheless, studies have been made concluding that having a single service for identification might actually improve the general security of the service that are depending on it [CITE]. One big factor is that by nature any web service is, to some level, vulnerable to phishing [CITE tai selitä aiemmin]. As previously explained, using a central identification provider allows a malicious party to focus his attack on that particular provider. But on the other hand, this also allows the service administrators to focus on the issues on only one particular identity provider [CITE]. Thus, if identification provider were to be implemented on a per service basis, it would require focusing on phishing issues on each and every one of them.

        <h1>User-centric Identity</h1>
        
        <pre>
          Giving full control of identity lifecycle to the customer is a prerequisite for user-centric identity. It allows the customer to decide when and how their identity information can be accessed <cite>open_identity_management_saas_2009</cite>. The term "user-centric identity management" is understood to mean digital identity infrastructure where an individual end-user has substantially independent control over the use of their identifier(s) and personally-identifiable information <cite>openid_2.0_platform_2009</cite>. OpenID specification provides user-centric infrastructure with two overall architectures: an address-based and a card-based identity.

          An address-based identity employs a unique digital address to identify a user. The identification process is based on proving the ownership of a particular address. For example an OpenID identity address may be composed of a URL or an XRI. One of the first steps in the OpenID authentication process is dereferencing the identity address to discover and invoke the associated identity service <cite>openid_2.0_platform_2009</cite>.

					[TODO: Esimerkki tähän! Esim. openid-kuva]
					
          A card-based identity uses a digital token that contains or references a collection of attributes that may individually or collectively identify the user <cite>openid_2.0_platform_2009</cite>. The collection provides the necessary information to accomplish an identity-based transaction. Technologies that use the WS-Trust protocol employ a card-based identity [CITE: Tälle oli viite!].

          According to Recordon and Reed <cite>openid_2.0_platform_2009</cite> both approaches can be applied individually, but they also can complement each other. As an example an address-based identity could be used to discover a card-based identity, and a card-based identity could contain one or more address-based identities.

          <h1>Concepts of Authentication and Authorization</h1>
      
          <pre>
            Authentication is usually considered a synonym for confirming the identity of a user. In order to gain trust, a user must first be identified. Claiming an identity, however, does not necessarily lead to trust between the identified user and the actual service: it only means that this requestor is able to present credentials for this identity. On the contrary, acquiring trust requires presenting identify first [CITE].

            Granting someone permissions to access a requested resource is generally called authorization. The authorization transaction is usually preceded by an authentication process to verify the identity of the requester. When the requester has been identified, the access control process checks that he be authorized to use the targeted resource. There are also cases where access can be granted without actually identifying the requester. Possible cases are requests that could, for instance, be authorized by requester's geological source address or simply by the time of the day. A request may also be authorized by an access token or ticket which grant access without proving the identity of the requester.

            Lampson et al. define a theory of authentication in distributed systems <cite>lampson_distributed_1992</cite>. They create an abstraction of many special cases to basic concepts of "principal, statement and channel". If <em>s</em> is a statement, for instance a request, then authentication answers the question "Who said <em>s</em>?" with a principal. Likewise, if <em>o</em> is an object, then authorization answers the question "Who is trusted to access <em>o</em>?" with a principal. A simple principal could for example be a person ("Peter"), a machine ("dac-123") or a role ("Manager"). A compound principal is build up of other principals such as "Peter as Manager" or "dac-123 as Department of CS" correspondingly.

            According to the theory of Lampson et al. <cite>lampson_distributed_1992</cite> a channel is the only kind of principal that can directly make statements to a computer. For example, there is no direct path from a person to a computer, that is, communication must be over some channel, involving keystrokes, wires, networks <em>et cetera</em>. Naturally some of these channels are not secure.

          <h1>Challenge-Response Authentication</h1>
          <pre>
            Challenge-Response authentication is a family of protocols, where one party presents a question (the challenge) for which another party needs to provide a valid answer ("response") to be authenticated <cite>wikipedia:Challenge-response_authentication</cite>. A simple example of challenge-response protocol is password authentication where one party asks for a username and password of which the another party needs to provide valid combination. However, if the communication channel may not be trusted, an eavesdropper might learn the response and exploit it.

            Software games of 1990s usually had piracy protection based on presenting a challenge and requiring a valid response for gameplay. Usually the challenge was an arbitrary question and the response could be found on a printed document which was delivered with a legal copy of the game. The motivation was that copying only the game files was not enough, and duplicating a printed document of codes was more difficult than only copying the files.

            Challenges may also involve a publicly known response. The motivation could, for instance, be restricting the group who may provide a response to only those who know Russian language, are familiar with an inside joke or are human users. A familiar example is a CAPTCHA verification [TODO: kuva!] for preventing spam-robot users. A challenge could be a simple mathematical operation asked in natural language or a number included in a scrambled bitmap image. The motivation is presenting a question which only a human is able to understand, although the actual answer is publicly known.

        <h1>Landscape of Phishing</h1>
        
        <pre>
          It is not feasible to produce a comprehensive catalog of phishing methods given both the current sophistication and rapid evolution of phishing attacks. Dhamija <em>et al.</em> <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite> organized studied phishing strategies along three dimensions: visual deception, lack of knowledge, and lack of attention. According to <cite>phishing_attacks_and_solutions_2007, suspectibility_to_phishing_2006</cite> general attack vectors include the following:
        
          <ul>
            <li>Deceptive attacks (spear phishing),
              which users are tricked by fraudulent messages into giving out
              information; could involve personalized emails or emails sent to a targeted group.
            </li>
            <li>Domain-based attacks (pharming attacks),
              which the lookup of hostnames is altered to send users to a
              fraudulent server.
            </li>
            <li>Malicious code-based or trojan-based attacks,
                in which malicious software causes data compromises.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Deceptive Phishing Attacks</h1>

          <pre>
            Several studies have shown [visual_similarity_phishing_2008, why_phishing_works_06, suspectibility_to_phishing_2006] that humans are especially vulnerable to visual deception. Dhamija et al. <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite> provide empirical evidence about which phishing strategies are successful at deceiving average users. Their study shows that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. In order to "design web browsers, websites and other tools to shield users from such attacks," it is necessary to "understand which attack strategies are successful, and what proportion of users they fool." <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>.

            The biggest nordic bank Nordea has been targeted several times for different phishing attacks. A typical method has been to send a message illustrated in image [IMG: Nordea1] to thousands of recipients. Not all of the recipients are customers of the target service provider, but some are. And although not all of the customers will get fooled, some will. And because even one fooled customer means money for the attackers, phishing is a lucrative criminal business.

            Phishing message in image [IMG: Nordea1] includes an authentic looking link to the web bank and a request to go and fill all the one time passwords. The hyperlink is obfuscated: it does not lead where it points. Instead the link leads to a phishing site illustrated in image [IMG: Nordea2] where the victim is supposed to fill in their unused passwords and all of the confirmation codes for Nordea's online banking <cite>nordea_fsecure_2006, nordea_miller_2006</cite>. The link also includes a unique identification code which allows the attacker to identify the recipient: consequentially it not necessary to ask for the customer's email address on the phishing site.

                 class="fit-width">
        
            Deceptive phishing could be taken even further. Above examples consisted only of passive attacks that tried to steal user's credentials. Active phishing is more sophisticated and has a bigger potential for causing trouble. Instead of being disconnected from the authentic site, the phishing site could act as a man-in-the-middle [TODO: Selitä esittelyssä] proxy that acts interactively with the site it imitates. This could allow bypassing of all security measures protecting the authentication process <cite>beamauth_2factor_2007, schneier_2factor_2005, why_phishing_works_06</cite>: when the authentic site asks a challenge, the man-in-the-middle just delegates the question to the user. And when the user sends the response, it is delivered through the man-in-the-middle. As a result the transaction is compromised, because the original request can be altered without user's notice.
          
            When the user creates a transaction, e.g. pay 10 &euro; to a friend, the phishing site intercepts the request. The request may then be replaced with a new one created by the man-in-the-middle. The bank starts the verification process to authorize the request. The user is still shown details about the request he created, but the bank did not receive it. Instead, the verification process is for the fraudulent request created by the phishing site. When the user send his response to the verification challenge, he provides it to the man-in-the-middle. The user still thinks he is authorized his own request, even though he actually authorized the malicious request created by the phishing site.
          
            This kind of active phishing is hard to prevent. Transport layer security (TLS) and secure sockets authentication (SSL) are designed to prevent this kind of vulnerabilities with secure certificates. But studies <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>[, CITE, CITE] show that users can't be protected using only a technical approach. For example the Firefox browser is designed to walk over user's judgement by default. The Mozilla Security Reviewers' Guide <cite>mozilla_security_guide_2010</cite> states: "Many of our potential users are inexperienced computer users, who do not understand the risks involved in using interactive Web content. This means we must rely on the user's judgement as little as possible."
        
            Study data of Downs <em>et al.</em> <cite>suspectibility_to_phishing_2006</cite> suggest that people can manage the risks that they are most familiar with, but don't appear to be wary of unfamiliar risks. Since lack of knowledge and attention is a considerable factor in being susceptible to phishing <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>, there exists a famous assertion regarding the correlation of dancing pigs and users' interest on security:
            
            <blockquote>
                "If J. Random Websurfer clicks on a button that promises dancing pigs on his computer monitor, and instead gets a hortatory message describing the potential dangers of the applet — he's going to choose dancing pigs over computer security any day. If the computer prompts him with a warning screen like: 'The applet DANCING PIGS could contain malicious code that might do permanent damage to your computer, steal your life's savings, and impair your ability to have children,' he'll click OK without even reading it. Thirty seconds later he won't even remember that the warning screen even existed." <cite>schneier_secrets_and_lies_2000</cite>
            </blockquote>
            
        </pre>
      </section> <!-- Deceptive -->
        
      <section>
        <h1>Lack of Knowledge and Attention</h1>
        <pre>
          Many users do not understand security indicators <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>. For example, many users do not know that a closed padlock icon in the browser indicates that the page they are viewing was secured by SSL. Studies of Dhamija <em>et al.</em> show that even if they understand the meaning of that icon, users can be fooled by its placement within the body of a webpage. Generally, users are not aware of the difference between the elements displayed in the browser's interface and the elements displayed in the content area. The browser interface consists of e.g. toolbars, windows, address bar, and status bar that are constructed around the web page. The browser interface cannot be altered by a web page, thus, icons and notifications displayed in it should be trusted. On the contrary, icons and notifications displayed in the content of a web page can be placed there arbitrarily and should not be trusted.
          
          A surprising finding by Dhamija <em>et al.</em> <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite> was that some users have erroneous knowledge and misconceptions about what website features indicate security. For example, "participants assumed that if websites contained professional-looking images, animations, and ads, they assumed the sites were legitimate." Similarly, dedicated login pages to bank services were less trusted than login form that was on the bank front page. For user convenience, some legitimate organizations allow users to login from non-SSL pages. Although the data may be transmitted securely (login form submitted to an https url), the browser does not display a visual cue if SSL is used for form submission. As a workaround designers may place a padlock icon in the page content. Users who know to look for an SSL padlock icon may simply scan for the presence of it regardless of position, which is feasible for phishers since they can add a padlock in the phishing site too.
          
          In addition to understanding the security indicators of the browser, users lack of basic knowledge about how the web, email and applications work <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>. Phishing sites can exploit several aspects of this lack of knowledge. For example some users do not understand the syntax of domain names and can not distinguish an authentic web address from a fraudulent one. For example a user may think <em>ebay-members-security.com</em> belongs to <em>ebay.com</em>, address <em>www.nordea.com.sitemod.sess26xvwcwbcnnzoycvszh.blockerey.tw/confirm/portal.aspx/login</em> to <em>www.nordea.com</em> or that a URL <em>http://www.microsoft.com:login.asp@62.236.117.4</em> is originated from <em>www.microsoft.com</em> instead of <em>62.236.117.4</em>. Dhamija <em>et al.</em> <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite> also found that "legitimate organizations further confused our participants by hosting secure pages with third parties, where the domain name does not match the brand name."
          
          <!-- tupla-v bankofthevvest.com -->
          
          Security is often a secondary goal <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>, even though security cannot be applied independently or afterwards <cite>schneier_secrets_and_lies_2000, lampson_distributed_1992</cite>. Even if users have the knowledge described above and can detect visual deception described in chapter [#REF] they may still be deceived if they fail to notice security indicators or the absence of them <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>. The Firefox browser shows NUM indicators for SSL protected pages as shown in figure [TODO: TEE KUVA]. However, there is no indicator for pages not protected by SSL. Many users do not notice the absence of an indicator and sometimes it is possible to insert a spoofed image of an indicator where one does not exist <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>.
          
          Dhamija <em>et al.</em> conclude <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite> that "even in the best case scenario, when users expect spoofs to be present and are motivated to discover them, many users cannot distinguish a legitimate website from a spoofed website." Indicators whose sole purpose is to report on site's trustworthiness were not understood or noticed by many participants. 23% of their participants ignored all security indicators as well as and cues in the browser's status bar and address bar. Their study suggests that rather than trying to solve phishing related problems from a technical point of view, the user experience must be designed taking into account what humans do not do well. Dhamija <em>et al.</em> point out that security indicators should alert users of an untrusted state - in addition to have indicators appear under trusted conditions. Ironically their study had just demonstrated that most users would simply dismiss such alerts.

        <h1>Trojan-based Attacks</h1>
        
        <pre>
          "Game Over" could be used to describe getting infected by a trojan. 
          Uninvited code or a program executed without user's "actual" permission is called a trojan. The victim is usually asked, if he wishes to install this particular program. As explained previously in the quote about dancing pigs <cite>schneier_secrets_and_lies_2000</cite> and studied in <cite>why_phishing_works_06</cite>, the victim usually does not bother reading any warnings.
          
          Very clever infiltrating methods have been found in the wild. One intriguing example is a malicious website which directly tells the visitor that it is a malicious website <cite>fsecure_webtrojan_2010</cite>. The site masquerades as a browser warning page and applies the correct layout and contents according to the victim's browser. The difference with the authentic page is that the malicious one offers a link to "download updates". The "update" contains a browser specific trojan. Although a confirmation action is required for the installation, the victim may happily agree with it and proceed with the installation as visualized in figure <a href="#firefox_reported_attack_page" data-lattex="image-ref"></a>. 
          
          
          <!-- Beating the dancing pigs <cite>schneier_secrets_and_lies_2000</cite> seems to require either restrictive system administration [CITE], effective anti-virus software [CITE] or software security education [CITE].

        <h1>Technical Remedies Against Phishing</h1>
    
        <pre>
          A good solution against the web site phishing should be able to ensure the user's privacy, even if the user has sent such credentials to a falsified web server <cite>phishing_attacks_and_solutions_2007</cite>. In other words, even if the phishing site receives user's login credentials, they could not be re-used to log in to the legitimate system. Different kinds of schemes have been developed to achieve this, most interesting ones being implementing a two-factor authentication <cite>schneier_2factor_2005, google_2step_2010</cite>[CITE, CITE] on the application level and extending the TLS protocol <cite>phishing_attacks_and_solutions_2007, foafssl_henrystory</cite>[CITE: others?] on the network protocol level.

        At the moment, the most popular and widely-deployed anti-phishing techniques are based on the use of blacklists <cite>visual_similarity_phishing_2008</cite>. These blacklists store a set of known [#dic: havaittuja] phishing domains. When the user visits a blacklisted domain, the browser displays a warning page and tries to prevent the user from visiting. However, as described previously in chapter [#REF], this approach is vulnerable to visual deception.
        
        </pre>

      
        <!-- 
        copypaste suspectibility_to_phishing_2006 :
        Wu et al. conducted a study of three simulated anti-phishing toolbars to determine how effective they were at preventing users from visiting web sites that the tools had determined to be fraudulent [11]. They found that many of their participants ignored the passive toolbar security indicators and instead used the site’s content to decide whether or not it was a scam. In some cases participants did not notice warning signals, and in other cases they noticed them but assumed the warnings were invalid. In a follow-up study the authors tested anti-phishing toolbars that produced pop-up warnings that blocked access to fraudulent websites until overridden by the user. These pop-up warnings reduced the rate at which users fell for fraudulent sites, but did not completely prevent all users from falling for these sites. The authors concluded that Internet users are not very good at interpreting security warnings and are unfamiliar with common phishing attacks and recommended online safety practices.

        <h1>Two-factor Authentication</h1>
      
        <pre>
          When challenge-response authentication is applied once, user is generally asked a password. A correct password is enough to complete the identification process. Two-factor authentication, also called as two-step verification, takes the process further. It provides the user with two challenges: first one depends on something that the user <em>knows</em> (password) and second one on something that the user <em>has</em> (e.g. a phone number). The second factor can be formed by, for example, sending the user a verification code via an SMS message. To complete the authentication, the user must respond with a valid answer to both of the challenges.

          A renowned senior security expert Bruce Schneier disagrees on the added security about two-step verification <cite>schneier_2factor_2005</cite>. He states that "it solves the security problems we had 10 years ago, not the security problems we have today." Let us think that an internet bank service, such as described in the previous chapter, sends a challenge to the user's phone number via an SMS message and expects a reply via SMS. If all bank customers are expected to have a cellphone, then this adds a two-factor authentication without extra hardware. The verification message is also transferred over another communications channel, which makes eavesdropping significantly more difficult.

          Nevertheless, according to <cite>schneier_2factor_2005</cite> [OISKO muitakin?] this does not increase security as a whole because the weakest link is elsewhere. "An attacker using a man-in-the-middle attack is happy to have the user deal with the SMS portion of the log-in, since he can’t do it himself." <cite>schneier_2factor_2005</cite> As explained in chapter [REF: edellinen kpl], if the user communicates with the authentic service having a man-in-the-middle, then two-factor authentication cannot help. The user can reply to all challenges proposed by the authentic bank, but he has no way of knowing that his request has been modified.

          Google rolled out two-step verification as a part of their Google Apps authentication process in September 2010 <cite>google_2step_2010</cite>. Google was cautious in their announcement which only promised to provide a "more secure" cloud authentication. They agree indirectly with Schneier <cite>schneier_2factor_2005</cite> by stating that the improvement helps only on stolen passwords.

        Two-factor authentication is not useless. It works for local log-in, and it works within some
        corporate networks. But it won’t work for remote authentica- tion over the Internet. I predict that
        banks and other financial institutions will spend millions of dollars outfitting their users with
        two-factor authen- tication tokens. Early

          Conclusively the standard security indicators in the browser context are not effective for a substantial fraction of end users.

          - Certificate (digital certificate, public key certificate)

          "The popular anti-phishing method for OpenID is asking user to provide additional information when they sign up. When relaying party redirects the user to the OpenID provider, the information provided by the user appears firstly, [..] so user can identify whether it is a phishing site [..]" <cite>open_identity_management_saas_2009</cite>.

          OpenID is an open standard which supports decentralized architectures. OpenID 1.0 was originally developed in 2005 to allow lightweight authentication for blog post commenters in LiveJournal.com. [CITE] It is now deployed by a wide range of websites, particularly on sites having much user-generated content. As the user base has evolved, so has the need for new OpenID authentication features. Along the growth, the OpenID community has shared a common vision that OpenID could become and umbrella under which multiple technologies can fit. The intention has been to keep OpenID free and open so that no one company owned or controlled the specification <cite>openid_2.0_platform_2009</cite>.

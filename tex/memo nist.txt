''Assertions are statements from a Verifier to an RP that contain information about a
Subscriber. Assertions are used when the RP and the Verifier are not collocated (i.e., they
are connected through a shared network). The RP uses the information in the assertion to
identify the Claimant and make authorization decisions about his or her access to
resources controlled by the RP. An assertion may include identification and
authentication statements regarding the Subscriber, and may additionally include attribute
statements that further characterize the Subscriber and support the authorization decision
at the RP.''
%
''There are two basic models for assertion-based authentication. After successful
authentication with the Verifier, the Subscriber is issued an assertion or an assertion
reference, which the Subscriber uses to authenticate to the RP.''
%
''an assertion contains a set of claims or statements about an
authenticated Subscriber. Based on the statements contained within it, an authentication
assertion will fall into one of two categories (and either category can be used in both
direct and indirect models): Holder-of-Key Assertions ja Bearer Assertions. (sivu 83.)''

% ''Three types of assertion technologies will be discussed within this section: Web browser
%   cookies, SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) assertions, and Kerberos tickets''
%
''Cookies are effective as assertions for Internet single-sign-on where the RP and Verifier
are part of the same Internet domain, and when the cookie contains authentication status
for that domain. They are not usable in scenarios where the RP and the Verifier are part
of disparate domains.''
%
Cookies are also often used by the Claimant to re-authenticate to a server. This may be
considered to be a use of assertion technology. In this case, the server acts as a Verifier
when it sets the cookie in the Subscriber’s browser, and as an RP when it requests the
cookie from a Claimant who wishes to re-authenticate to it. Often, the cookie contains a
random number, and the assertion data that it represents does not leave the server.
